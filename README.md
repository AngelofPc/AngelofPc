### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Oluwapelumi.

I am a dedicated developer with over five (5) years of experience as a frontend developer and three (3) years developing applications
with the MERN stack. I also develop mobile applications using mostly react native. I am also a growing blockchain developer with
experience in writing smart contracts and integrating Dapps. 
I am a goal-driven team player who is able to communicate efficiently.
I am also happy and always ready to learn new technologies to get the job done. 

âš¡When I'm not writing codes, I'm writing poetry, reading novels, taking pictures or sleeping.
